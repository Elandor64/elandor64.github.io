Hey! My name is Florian Chudigiewitsch and I'm currently a computer science student at Leibniz Uni Hannover, Germany.

My main interests lie in theoretical computer science, in particular:

- theory of computation and proof theory -- what are the limits of computer science and mathematics?
- (non-classical) logic -- how can we capture semantics in formal mathematics?
- quantum computing -- what are the complexity implications of this model of computation and how can they be leveraged?
- type theory -- how can we use this "2 in 1" package of verified programming and proof checking?
- programming languages & paradigms -- where is the sweetspot between the usefulness of imperative languages and the safety of declarative languages and how complex should a type system be?

Further topics of interest include (but are not limited to): mathematics, physics, music, linguistics, history and philosophy.

My CV in english and german.
